title: Checklist - Before the week

> All these requirements should be met before the discovery week

* Clients should have already received the [Discovery Phase Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14QbXCpRvtPcEJ-TbYPSbJXEJ5xFbS_vOIckGJAUTAV0/edit#).
* Ensure that we have everything from the client that was listed in the [“Prerequisites” section of the Discovery Phase Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14QbXCpRvtPcEJ-TbYPSbJXEJ5xFbS_vOIckGJAUTAV0/edit#heading=h.2jz1on9cuw4)
* Share the Google Drive folder with everyone on our team
* Schedule meetings
  * Discovery-week-only meetings:
    * Kick-off call the week before (Wednesday or earlier) with the client to make sure everyone will be prepared
    * Monday morning meeting with the client to go into more details
    * Final meeting with client for Friday as early as possible.
    * Daily status meeting (15 minutes), development team only (including client only if they're technical)
  * [Recurring meetings for the rest of the project](https://github.com/okgrow/guides/tree/master/processes/development/project-management#meetings) (it's easier to do no end date in case the project is extended).
* Client should have given us access to a repo and instructions to set up a dev environment
* Create Trello board
  * For consulting projects use: [https://trello.com/b/aih9u2u6](https://trello.com/b/aih9u2u6)
  * For feature/app development projects use: [https://trello.com/b/lPS0CYbG](https://trello.com/b/lPS0CYbG)
* Create Slack channel for ourselves named #projectname
* Create Slack channel for communication with the client named #projectname-client
* Create project email alias (Google Group): &lt;project&gt;@okgrow.com
* Send the project email to the Slack channel:
  * In “Posting permissions” edit the “Post” setting and allow public to post.
  * In "Basic permissions" check the checkbox for "Allow members external to this organization" then under "Join the group" select "Anyone can ask"
  * Add Slack email integration for the project channel
    * Set &lt;project&gt;@okgrow.com as the descriptive title
    * Copy the email address
  * Add the email address to the Google Group using "Direct add members"
  * You may now go back to "Basic permissions" and uncheck the checkbox for "Allow members external to this organization" then under "Join the group" change it back to just "Anyone in the organization can ask"
* Create project info doc, copy from [template](https://docs.google.com/a/okgrow.com/document/d/1KUVInohhNZxmrlsJw7Ax5MMQraawglGpTo1O-eXJ030/edit) into project folder.
