Fridays are "investment time", we work on internal things like our open-source projects rather than client work.

This helps us keep our tools sharp, our knowledge sharp, and improve the open-source foundation that all our work (and indeed all modern software) is based on.

It keeps us engaged with the community and all "investment time" work should be focused on something that we provide to the community.
