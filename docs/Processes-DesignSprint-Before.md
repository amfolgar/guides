##### Schedule a kick-off call

* At least a week before

##### Source Testers

* From the learnings we made, confirm a medium of where to source testers
* Confirm the number of testers

##### Send prep materials

* Our [Design Sprint Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19noBKPSdyl5ZsHruveSMabuLf-an_XGgcRt5Df4a1y8/edit#)

##### Gather info

* Understand who will we be participating
  * Get a list of participants, names, titles, responsibilities, etc.
  * Which part of the product is each participant responsible for?
* Understand ideal customer
  * Target demographics
  * Opinions they might have on their ideal demographics
    * This will help us (OK GROW!) ask questions to that demographic regarding the idea before Day 1 and form our own opinions
* If sprint is on an existing product
  * Links to their current product/app/website
  * Any analytics on the current product
  * Understand the product
    * What is the impact of the product on your existing business
    * What do you want the users to do with your app (success criteria)
    * Why doesn’t it currently work? What is it not accomplishing for your current users?

##### Hand pick exercises based on our learnings to get the best outcome

* Example: If it’s an existing app we are working on, we should include `User Journey Map` exercise.
* New product? More mind maps
* Difficulty detailing target demographic? More personas

##### Ensure that we have supplies

* Markers
* Whiteboard / large paper
* Sticky notes
* Dot stickers
* Snacks

##### Prepare to create capture document

* Create empty document from the template and prepare to fill it out throughout the week

##### Tips on snacks and how to keep the energy up throughout the day:

* The obvious one is reduce high carb, late lunches
* Stay hydrated
* Being very precise on when to take breaks.
  * Make sure that everyone knows when breaks happen so everyone can focus on the sprint.
