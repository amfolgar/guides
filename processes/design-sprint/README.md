# Design Sprint Guide

### Prepare for the Sprint (Package we send out)
---
Congratulations! You are on your way to running a successful Sprint!

##### Rules
* Everyone participates
* One conversation at a time
* Withhold judgement
* Get up and draw
* Be Comfortable - clothing, relaxed, room
* Easy on people, tough on ideas
* On time, be present
* No phones!
* No jargon
* No “yes, but”
* No HiPPO (Highest paid person in the Office)
* No part-time participants
* Testing the Idea, not the design

##### Focus on the Journey
We aren’t building a full mockup, we are validating (or invalidating) an idea. Reiterate this every day.

##### Materials
* Markers
* Full-Poster sticky paper
* Dot stickers
* Small and Medium sized post-its

### Before the Sprint
---
##### Schedule a kick-off call

* At least a week before

##### Source Testers

- From the learnings we made, confirm a medium of where to source testers
- Confirm the number of testers

##### Send prep materials

* Our [Design Sprint Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19noBKPSdyl5ZsHruveSMabuLf-an_XGgcRt5Df4a1y8/edit#)

##### Gather info

* Understand who will we be participating
  * Get a list of participants, names, titles, responsibilities, etc.
  * Which part of the product is each participant responsible for?
* Understand ideal customer
  * Target demographics
  * Opinions they might have on their ideal demographics
      * This will help us (OK GROW!) ask questions to that demographic regarding the idea before Day 1 and form our own opinions
* If sprint is on an existing product
  * Links to their current product/app/website
  * Any analytics on the current product
  * Understand the product
      * What is the impact of the product on your existing business
      * What do you want the users to do with your app (success criteria)
      * Why doesn’t it currently work? What is it not accomplishing for your current users?

##### Hand pick exercises based on our learnings to get the best outcome
* Example: If it’s an existing app we are working on, we should include `User Journey Map` exercise.
* New product? More mind maps
* Difficulty detailing target demographic? More personas

##### Ensure that we have supplies

* Markers
* Whiteboard / large paper
* Sticky notes
* Dot stickers
* Snacks

##### Prepare to create capture document

* Create empty document from the template and prepare to fill it out throughout the week

##### Tips on snacks and how to keep the energy up throughout the day:
* The obvious one is reduce high carb, late lunches
* Stay hydrated
* Being very precise on when to take breaks. 
    * Make sure that everyone knows when breaks happen so everyone can focus on the sprint.
