# OK GROW!'s development processes

## Principles

These are the overarching principles that guide the actual details of the process:

- **Quality is the most important thing. Above all else.** This means taking time to do things correctly, and prioritizing bugs and errors above all else.
- Maximizing frequent output is more important than individual efficiency. Help others, and ask for help for yourself.
- Work in progress should be minimized. Anything started but not 100% delivered is a scheduling risk (it's hard to know really how close to done it is), and "waste" (in the Lean sense). “100% delivered” means the client has reviewed and accepted it, it's deployed to production, and there are no small things left for later unless they’re defined as a separate card.
- We make short-term commitments to ourselves and our clients, as a team, not as individuals.
- We peer-review everything.
- Items with deadlines are given the same priority as bugs and errors, and are to be completed before any other tasks
- Provide good test coverage. The value it brings is tremendous
- Don't live with pain (duplicated code, glue code, yak-shaving). Take the time to solve the pain.
- Automate where possible. Make builds, deployments, and common tasks as painless as possible. By automating, you save time for everyone.
