# GitHub Labels

The `github_labels.json` file is here in order to specify the [labels](../open-source/contributing.md#labels) we use in our repositories. These labels can be applied automatically to all repositories in the organization by running [org-labels](https://github.com/repo-utils/org-labels):

```sh
# Install
npm i -g org-labels
# Run
org-labels standardize okgrow okgrow/guides
```

Individual labels may be created individually using the GitHub interface, as well.
